    Mission: 
    Why are we making this game?
    What issue does it address?
    !Loopy Model goes in here!

<!-- 
    {from Mr. S.} your style may not be displaying properly because it is not inside the <head> tag as the browser expects
    See here: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_style.asp
    A quick fix would be to move it into your head section.  An even better fix would be to move it into a separate file with
    just the CSS and no HTML called "style.css" as shown here: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_howto.asp
    The big advantage then is you can write one set of code for style information and then just reference it on all your different 
    HTML pages instead of having to go and make changes in a bunch of different places.  One warning about using an external stylesheet
    while you are still developing the code is that (because stylesheets change less frequently than HTML content sometimes your browser
    won't go and fetch the stylesheet on every visit and instead just use the one it loaded last time.  If you made changes and they're not
    showing up that could be happening.  To resolve, do a "hard refresh" for your browser.  CTRL + Click refresh for Chrome on PC
    OPT + CMD + E for Safari on Mac.  Google hard refresh + your browser for anything else.
